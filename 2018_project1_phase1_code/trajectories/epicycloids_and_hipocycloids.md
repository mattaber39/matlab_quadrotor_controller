# What are the Epicycloids and Hipocycloids?

Epicycloids and Hipocycloids are very fun to work with, they are parametric functions that can make figures that resemble flowers and stars, respectevely. 

## Epicycloids
x = (a+b)cos((p)t)  -  (b)cos(p((a+b)/b)t)

y = (a+b)sin((p)t)  -  (b)sin(p((a+b)/b)t)

## Hipocycloids
x = (a-b)cos((p)t)  +  (b)cos(p*((b-a)/b)t)

y = (a-b)sin((p)t)  +  (b)sin(p((b-a)/b)t)

## Explanation
The period of a Cos and Sin function is 2pi if the argument is (t). If the want the period to last 80 seconds, for example, we divide 2pi/80 and we will multiply this by the argument inside the function.
